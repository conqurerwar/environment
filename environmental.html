                <h2 style="width: auto;">Some points on causes of soil pollution</h2><br><br>
                <h3>Industrial Pollution</h3><br>
                    <p>The discharge of industrial waste into soils can result in soil pollution.  
                    In India, as mining and manufacturing activities are increasing rapidly, soil degradation is also increasing. 
                    The extraction of minerals from the earth is responsible for affecting soil fertility.</p><br>
                <h3>Agricultural Activities</h3><br>
                    <p>The use of insecticides and pesticides for a long period can cause soil pollution. 
                        Repetitive use can cause insects and pests to become resistant to it. 
                        Instead of killing pests and insects, it degrades the soil quality. </p><br> 
                <h3>Waste Disposal</h3><br>
                    <p>of plastics and other solid waste is a serious issue that causes soil pollution, 
                    disposal of electrical items such as batteries causes an adverse effect on the soil due to the presence of harmful chemicals.
                     Eg: lithium present in batteries can cause the leaching of soil. Human waste such as urine, faeces, diapers, etc is dumped directly in the land. 
                     It causes both soil and water pollution.</p><br>
                <h3>Acid Rain</h3><br>
                    <p></p>It is caused when pollutants present in the air mix with the rain and fall back on the ground. 
                    The polluted water could dissolve away some of the essential nutrients found in soil and change the structure of the soil thus making it unsuitable for agriculture.</p><br>  
                <h3>Heavy Metals</h3><br>
                    <p>The presence of heavy metals (such as lead and mercury) in very high concentrations present in soils can cause them to become highly toxic for human beings.</p>

            <div class="harm3">
                <h3>Effects on Human and Animal</h3><br>
                
                <p>The contamination of soil has a major consequence on human health. 
                    Crops and plants that are grown on polluted soil absorb most of the pollution and then pass them to humans. 
                    Living, working, or playing in contaminated soil can lead to respiratory diseases, skin diseases, and other health problems</p><br><br>
                <h3>Effects on Plants</h3><br>
                <p>In such a short period of time, plants are unable to adapt to the soil change chemistry.
                     Fungi and bacteria found in the soil that bind them together start to decline, which creates an additional problem in soil erosion. 
                     Regular use of chemical fertilizers, inorganic fertilizers, pesticides will decrease the fertility of the soil and alter the structure of soil. 
                     This will lead to a decrease in soil quality and poor quality of crops. </p><br><br>
                <h3>Effects on Ecosystem</h3>
                <p>The soil is an important habitat for different types of microorganisms, birds, and insects. Thus, change in the chemistry of soil can negatively impact the lives of living organisms and can result in the gradual death of many organisms.

            <h1>Measures and Control of Soil Pollution</h1>
            <div class="control1">
                <h3>Reduced Use of Chemical Fertilizers</h3>
                <p>Chemical fertilizers are more damaging than helpful. 
                    While the right quantity can help the soil become more fertile, too much might potentially poison it. 
                    Chemical fertilizers in excess could harm the soil in a variety of ways. 
                    It has the ability to affect the soil's pH values.</p>
                <h3>Reforestation and Afforestation</h3>
                <p>Soil erosion, which is produced by deforestation, is one of the major sources of soil pollution.
                     With an ever-increasing population, it is only logical that mankind requires more and more room to expand their civilization.
                      It is frequently accomplished at the expense of soil health.</p>  
                <h3>Proper Solid Waste Treatment</h3>
                <p>Solid waste must be appropriately disposed of by being processed before being released into the environment.
                    To prevent soil pollution, acidic and alkaline trash, for instance, might be neutralized before disposal.
                    Before being dumped into the environment, biodegradable waste should also be decomposed in a controlled atmosphere.</p>   
                <h3>Proper Management of Agricultural Land & Practice of Organic Farming</h3> 
                <p>An important factor in the prevention and management of soil pollution is proper land use.
                    Since agricultural land pollution results in the loss of organic matter, topsoil, nutrients, and the soil's capacity to retain water, it typically results in the loss of soil fertility.
                    Mechanical and biological control strategies are appropriate for soil protection in agricultural land management.</p>    
                <h3>Four R’s</h3><br>
                <p><b>Refuse:</b> Using the containers that are already in the house rather than purchasing new ones from the store. Even if users think new products are better looking than the ones they already own, resisting the urge to purchase them is necessary.<br><br>
                    <b>Reuse:</b> Instead of throwing away soft drink cans or bottles, decorating them with homemade paper or paint and using them as pencil stands or miniature bouquets will be helpful in reducing soil pollution.<br><br>
                    <b>Recycle:</b> Using reusable shopping bags, such as those made of cloth or jute, and making sure that the rubbish is separated so that it can be picked up and taken for recycling will make a great difference in reducing soil pollution.<br><br>
                    <b>Reduce:</b> Carrying the individual shopping bag to the market and placing all of the goods inside of it should be encouraged. This will help generate less waste.</p>
